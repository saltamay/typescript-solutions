### Algorithm #13: Array of Products of All Elements

---

Given an array, return an array where each index stores the product of all numbers in the array except the number at the index itself.

Problem Statement #

Implement a function, findProduct(arr), which modifies an array so that each index has a product of all the numbers present in the array except the number stored at that index.

    Note: The size of an array should be greater than or equal to 2.

Input #

An array of numbers (can even be floats, integers, and negative!)
Output #

An array such that each index has a product of all the numbers in the array except the number stored at that index.
Sample Input #

arr = [1,2,3,4]

Sample Output #

arr = [24,12,8,6]
